# Semester 1: Evolutionary Algorithms

## Repository Overview

This repository contains projects and implementations from the **Evolutionary Algorithms** course, completed as part of my Master's in Artificial Intelligence. Each project explores different techniques and applications of evolutionary computation, ranging from optimization problems to advanced regression models using neural networks.

## Projects Included

The repository is organized into the following projects, each implemented in its respective folder:

### 1. **8 Queens**
   - **Description**: Solves the classic 8 Queens problem using evolutionary algorithms.
   - **Objective**: Place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
   - **Key Techniques**: Genetic Algorithms (GA), fitness evaluation, mutation, and crossover.

### 2. **Bin Packing Optimization**
   - **Description**: Implements an evolutionary approach to solve the bin packing problem.
   - **Objective**: Minimize the number of bins required to pack a set of items of varying sizes.
   - **Key Techniques**: Chromosome representation for bin packing, fitness functions, and heuristic-based evolution.

### 3. **Constraint Optimization**
   - **Description**: Applies evolutionary algorithms to solve constraint satisfaction problems.
   - **Objective**: Find solutions that satisfy multiple constraints in an optimization problem.
   - **Key Techniques**: Penalty-based fitness evaluation and constraint handling mechanisms.

### 4. **Evolutionary Strategy Regression with Neural Networks**
   - **Description**: Combines evolutionary strategies with neural networks for regression tasks.
   - **Objective**: Optimize neural network weights using evolutionary strategies for better regression performance.
   - **Key Techniques**: Evolutionary Strategies (ES), neural network design, and regression analysis.

### 5. **Gene Expression Programming**
   - **Description**: Implements Gene Expression Programming (GEP) for symbolic regression tasks.
   - **Objective**: Derive mathematical expressions or models from data using GEP.
   - **Key Techniques**: Chromosome encoding, expression trees, and symbolic regression.

### 6. **Multi-Objective Optimization with Fast NSGA-II**
   - **Description**: Implements the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization.
   - **Objective**: Solve multi-objective problems by optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously.
   - **Key Techniques**: Pareto front generation, crowding distance calculation, and non-dominated sorting.
